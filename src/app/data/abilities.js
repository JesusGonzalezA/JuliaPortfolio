        <p>
          I am a publicist and public relations professional with a passion for
          the world of social media. In recent months, I have taken my
          creativity and skills to the next level through digital marketing,
          discovering a new passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience abroad has also been instrumental in my development. For
          nine months, I had the opportunity to live in Lithuania, immersing
          myself in a completely different culture. This experience has taught
          me to step out of my comfort zone without difficulty, and to enjoy the
          company of people from different cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why I am ready to take on any challenge that comes my way.
